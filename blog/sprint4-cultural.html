			<h3>1. Reserach Neuroplasticity</h3>				
			<h4>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h4>
				<p>
					neuroplasticity is an umbrella term referring to the ability of your brain to reorganise itself, both physically and functionally, through experiences to your environment, behaviour, thinking, and emotions.
					previously, scientists thought that the brain's structure was hard-wired and immutable. New research has taught us that <strong>the brain is actually plastic, it is able to change based on experiences.</strong> Even in old age, the adult brain retains neuroplasticity and is able to change its structure and functon. 
					Neuroplasticity enables people to recover from stroke, injury, and helps create new ways of functioning and behaviour for those experiencing autisem, ADD, learning disabilities, depression and addiction and reverse obsessive-compulsive patterns. 
				</p>	
			<h4>Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplaticity for your own benefit</h4>
				<p>
					Neuroplasticity study shows:<br>
					<ul>
						<li> - New thoughts and skills carve out new pathways</li>
						<li> - Repetition and strengthen these pathways, forming new habits.</li>
						<li> - Old pathways get used less and weaken.</li>
						<li> - With repeated anddirect attention towards a desired change, we all have a ability to rewire our brains.</li>
						<li> - Neural pathways connect relatively distant areas of the brain or nervous system, each pathway is associated with a particular action or behaviour</li>
						<li> - Everytime we think, feel or do something, we strengthen this pathway. Habits are well travelled pathways.- our brain finds these things easy to do</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>	
					For my own benefit, I would like to<br>
					<ul>
						<li> - First step is to realise that I need to train my brain with more new things, to be able to adapt to changes, for example to read a new book, try a different restaurant, take a different route while walking etc</li>
						<li> - shake up my daily routine, do something different</li>
						<li> - have a clear set of goals and progress</li>
						<li> - take risks and explore</li>
						<li> - focus solely on what I am doing</li>
					</ul>
				</p>	
			<h4>What are some of the ways to increase your Neuroplaticity</h4>
				<p>
					<ul>

						<li> - Get enough Magnesium</li>
						<li> - Sleep</li>
						<li> - Eat fish</li>
						<li> - Mitigate stress</li>
						<li> - Exercise</li>
						<li> - seek novelty - try something new</li>
						<li> - Learn a language</li>
					</ul>

			<h3>2. Research Growth Mindset</h3>

				<h4>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant?</h4>	
					<P>
						Growth Mindset means we can develop our ability through hard work and effort. Having a growth mindset (the belief that you are in control of your own ability, and can learn and improve) is the key to success.
					</P>
					<p>
						In people with a growth mindset, the brain is most active when they are being told what they could do to improve.<br>
						People with a growth mindset view a setback as an opportunity to learn. They tend to try harder in an effort to overcome the problem.
					</p>
					<p>	
						Professor Dweck explained growth mindset as, “In a growth mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence. They don’t necessarily think everyone’s the same or anyone can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Along with encouraging a growth mindset, helping students understand that their brain can actually grow and become stronger can also boost their confidence and improve learning. Research shows us that the brain is plastic: with focus and practice, the brain can change, it can grow new cells, and we can strengthen neurologic pathways. This is called neuroplasticity, or the ability of the brain to restructure itself based on repetitive practices. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Mindsets are not just important for learning new skills. They can affect the way that we think about everything.
						For example, a growth mindset can help you recover from illness because you believe that you can do something about the illness. They can help you achieve in sport, at work and can also help you grow and develop in relationships.
						Cultivating a growth mindset could be the single most important thing you ever do to help you achieve success.
					</p>


				<h4>In this exploration, did anything surprise you?</h4>
					<p>
						Growth mindset is a very new concept for me and I am so glad that it is part of sprint 4 core study and I am keen to learn more about it. The contents about Neuroplasticity and growth mindset are very interesting and what I have read and explored online today truely opened up my mind, I want to make changes and train myself to be a growth mindset person, to be more successfully in my life. 
						There will be a lot of practice needed, but in my daily life I can start with<br>
						<ol>
							<li>Learn how to praise my chirdren</li>
								To praise a child in a right way, saying "Great job on that test! You must be so smart!” may sound good and harmless, but it can actually have a negative affect and create a fixed mindset, Instead of telling a child he must have done well because he is smart, try saying something like, “Great job on that test! You must have worked really hard!” Focusing on the work it took to achieve a goal helps create a healthy attitude and belief that he can improve and succeed with continued effort. This is the idea behind a growth mindset.
							<li>Encouraging myself to try new different things</li>

							<li>Don't be afraid of breaking my existing routines</li>
							
							<li>There is no failure, it is just NOT YET, as long as I am keep working on it, a small step will become a big step.</li>
						</ol>	
					</p>	
				<h4>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h4>
					<p>
						There are three key things that we can do to develop a growth mindset:
						<ol>
							<li>We need to recognise that a growth mindset is not just good, but is also supported by science. In other words, we need to be committed to developing a growth mindset.</li>
							<li>We can learn and teach others about how to develop and improve their abilities through adopting a growth mindset. This will help us to take control of our life, which is hugely empowering. Research shows that people who feel in control tend to perform better. It’s a virtuous cycle.</li>
							<li>Listen out for our fixed mindset voice. When we hear that little critical voice in our head telling us that we can’t do something, reply with a growth mindset approach and tell it that we can learn.</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				<h4>How am I going to integrate growth mindset into my learning? </h4>
					<p>
						I think I can start with:<bR>	
						<ol>
							<li>I need to be committed to developing a growth mindset</li> 
							<li>Listen out for my fixed mindset voice. When I hear that little critical voice in my head telling me that I can’t do something, reply with a growth mindset approach and tell it that I can learn.</li>
							<li>There is no failure, it is just NOT YET, if I can’t work things out, I just need to keep working on it, a little progress will lead to final success.</li>
							<li>Understanding I will learn more from hard work and effort as we are build up our ability through hard work. </li>
						</ol>

			<h3>Blend with your learning plan and strategy</h3>
			 	<h4> Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h4>
			 		<p>
			 			<ol>
			 				<li>Practice new way to solve problems, for example, practicing write function in a short way</li>
			 				<li>Try different learning plans</li>
			 				<li>Try different routines</li>
			 				<li>Try different problem solving skills</li>
