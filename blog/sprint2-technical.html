What are best practices associated with using classes vs ids?
---

We need ways to describe content in a HTML document. The basic elements like h1, p, and ul will often do the job, but our basic set of tags doesn't cover every possible type of page element or layout choice. For this we need ID's and Classes. 

So what is the difference between class and id?

## ID's are unique

Each element can have only one ID

Each page can have only one element with that ID, For example <ul id="nav">, this will give us the chance to target this unordered list specifically, so that we may manipulate it uniquely to other unordered lists on our page.
	
	in your css file - I defined an id named nav
	/**remove the bullet button for that perticular unordered list*/
	#nav{
       list-style-type: none;
		margin: 0;
		padding: 0;
	}
  
   in my html file - I can apply this id to the particular ul I want it for
   <ul id="nav">
 		<li>list1<li>
 		<li>list2</li>	
   </ul>	

 Or we might have a section on our page that has no relevant tag to signify it, for example a footer, where we might do something like this: <div id="footer">.
 	
 	in main.css - I defined an id named footer

 /** define footer style */
   #footer{
   		padding: 10px;
		text-align: centre;
		background: #2F4F4F;
		margin-top: 10px;
		color: white;
}
  
   in my html file - apply footer id to footer only

   <div id="footer"> footer contents</div>
 
## Classes are NOT unique
You can use the same class on multiple elements.
You can use multiple classes on the same element.
Any styling information that needs to be applied to multiple objects on a page should be done with a class. Take for example a page with multiple "outline", which gives awesome outline effect to the text. 

in my css file, I defined a class named outline,
/** define the outline effect to text */

.outline {
	color: black;
	text-shadow: 0px 0px 6px gold;
	font-size: 60px;
}

in my html file, I can apply outline class as many times as you need to
<div class="outline">outline text 1</div>
<div class="outline">outline text 2</div>
<div class="outline">outline text 3</div>

outline class have been repeatly applied in my html file.

Hope above examples explained the difference between classes and ids.
