            <h4>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h4>
                <p>
                    HTML is short for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>, it is used to create the actual content of the webpage; 
                    "Markup language" means that, rather than using a programming language to perform functions, HTML uses 
                    tags to identify different types of content and the purposes they serve to the webpage, these tags have 
                    pretty intuitive names: Header tags, paragraph tags, body tags etc.
                    CSS is short for <strong>Cascading Style Sheet</strong>, it is responsible for the design or style of the webstie, 
                    gives the HTML its styling and controls the layout and appearance of it, simply just make a webpage prettier, 
                    those slick colours, fancy fonts and background images, all thanks to CSS, CSS affects the entire mood and 
                    tones of a web page. 
                    You can think HTML as a builder while CSS is an artist.
                    HTML and CSS have different code and syntex, however you can use CSS in an HTML file, but cannot use HTML 
                    in a CSS style sheet.
                    As common practice, HTML and CSS are kept separate to ensure websites are built correctly before they're 
                    reformatted, and it also makes easier if you wish to change the appearances of your website in the future.
                 </p>   
            <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 
                'brushing your teeth'.</h4>
                <p>
                    The contral flow is the order in which the computer executes statments in a script. for example brushing 
                    your teech, the flows are:
                    <ol>
                        <li>squeeze a pea size of tooth paste onto your tooth brush</li>
                        <li>Rinse your mouth before you starting brush your teeth</li>
                        <li>starting brush until they are all clean, it takes about 2 minutes</li>
                        <li>Rinse your mouth again until it is clean</li>
                    </ol> 
                    <strong>Loops</strong> in JavaScript are used to execute the same block of code a specified number of 
                    times or while a specified condition is true. Common used loops include:
                    <ul> 
                        <li><span class="smalldot"></span> <strong>while</strong></li>
                        <li><span class="smalldot"></span> <strong>for</strong> 
                        <li><span class="smalldot"></span> <strong>do/while</strong></li>
                        Take an example of eating breakfaset, you are eating a bowl of cornflakes which is about 100g, 
                        and each spoonful of flakes you eat is about 5g, we can use while loop to show it<br>
                        <span class="fontGreen">// eating breakfast </span><br>
                        <span class="codefontcolor">var breakfast =100;</span> <span class="fontGreen">//starting with 100g breakfast</span><br>
                        <span class="codefontcolor">while(breakfast!=0){ </span><span class="fontGreen">// keep eating until breakfast is finished</span><br>
                        <span class="codefontcolor">breakfast-=5;} </span> <span class="fontGreen">// you eat a spoonful breakfast </span>
                                                                 
                    </ul>
            </h4>
            <h4>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it. </h4>
                
            <p>
                DOM stands for "Document Object Model" which is an application programming interface (API) 
                for valid HTML and well-formed XML documents.  <br>
                
                The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect 
                to the page.</p>
             <p>   
                DOM defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.<br>
                With the Document Object Model, programmers can build documents, navigate their structure, and add, 
                modify, or delete elements and content. Anything found in an HTML document can be accessed, 
                changed, deleted, or added using the Document Object Model.<br>
             </p>
             <p> 
                For example, a Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or 
                as the HTML source. But it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents 
                that same document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, 
                which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
            </p> 
            <p> 
                However, the DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making the structural 
                representation of the document available from a single, consistent API. Though we focus exclusively on JavaScript 
                but implementations of the DOM can be built for any language.</p>
            <p>
                Put it simple, The backbone of an HTML document are tags.<br>

                According to DOM, every HTML-tag is an object. Nested tags are called “children” of the enclosing one.<br>
                
                The text inside a tag it is an object as well.<br>
                
                All these objects are accessible using JavaScript.<br>
             </p>  
             <p> 
                 Here is a picture that shows how DOM interacts with html
             </p>

            <h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h4>
             <p>  
                Array elements must be accessed by using the bracket notation.</p>
             <p>
                Example of accessing an array item: <br>                
                <span class="codefontcolor"> var data = myArray[index];
                </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                 Example of looping over an array<br>
                 <span class="codefontcolor">for(var i=0; i < myArray.length; i++){<br> 
                     console.log(myArray[i]);<br>
                 }</span></p>
             <p>
                Data stored in simple objects, by contrast, is accessed by key,
                which you can think of as a name, An Object is logically a collection of properties. 
                Each property is either a data property, or an accessor property. 
                Object properties are accessed via their "key" names which are a string or symbol value
                Object properties can be accessed with 2 notations: dot & brackets
            </p>
            
                Example:<br>
                <span class="codefontcolor">var myCat { <br>
                    name: "mimi",<br>
                    age:  3, <br>
                    category: "scottish fold",<br>
                    favouriteFood["fish", "egg", "milk"]<br>
                }; </span><br>
             <p> 
                Above is an object called <strong>myCat</strong>, it contains 4 properties, <strong>name, age, category and faoriteFood </strong>which is reprsented by
                an array.
             </p>
             <p>  
                Access name property by dot <br>
                <span class="codefontcolor">myCat.name;</span> <span class="fontGreen">//return mimi</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Access name property by bracket<br>
                <span class="codefontcolor">myCat["name"];</span> <span class="fontGreen">//return mimi</span>
            </p>
             <p> Both way return the same value: mimi </p>


            <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h4>
            <p> What is a function?</p>
             <ul>
                <li><span class="smalldot"></span> A function is a subprogram designed to perform a particular task.</li>            
                <li><span class="smalldot"></span> Functions are executed when they are called. This is known as invoking a function.</li>
                <li><span class="smalldot"></span> Values can be passed into functions and used within the function.</li>
                <li><span class="smalldot"></span> Functions always return a value. In JavaScript, if no return value is specified, the function will return undefined.</li>
                <li><span class="smalldot"></span> Functions are objects.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Why functions are userful?</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="smalldot"></span> A function is a group of reuseable code which can be called anywhere in your program, no need 
                        to write code again and again </li>
                    <li><span class="smalldot"></span> A big program can be divided into a number of small and manageable functions</li>
                    <li> <span class="smalldot"></span> It can be also useful for debugging because you can see the function’s name in a call stack</li>
                    <li><span class="smalldot"></span> But some functions have no names, we call them anonymous functions, why are are anonymous functions useful?<br>
                            -If no name is needed because the function is only ever called in one place, 
                             then no point to add a name to whatever namespace you're in.<br>
                            -Anonymous functions are normally declared inline and inline functions have advantages in 
                             that they can access variables in the parent scopes. 
                    </li>
                 </ul>
