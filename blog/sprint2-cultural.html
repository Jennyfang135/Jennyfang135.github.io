			<p>This learning agreement is about how I am managing my web development courses studying at EDA. </p>

			<p>First of all, I have passion on coding/programming, I have a bachelor degree in computer science from Auckland University and programming is always my dreaming job, no doubt that I am motivated and have fully committed to this course.</p>

			
			<p>
				<h3>My strengths are </h3>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="smalldot"></span> I have learned Java before and have basic ideas about programming;</li>
						<li><span class="smalldot"></span> I am reponsible and well organised, once I commit to something, I will try my best to complete it;</li>
						<li><span class="smalldot"></span> I work hard and have eyes on details, I tends to finish my tasks in time and achieve my goals;</li>
						<li><span class="smalldot"></span> I am perservative and won't give up easily</li>
					</ul>
			</p>
			<p>	
			    <h3>My limitations are</h3>
			       <ul>
			    	<li><span class="smalldot"></span>  I am mother of two, I have a busy life, I need to balance my study and family life, doing things efficiently is very important to me, so I must stick with my study plan and finish it on time; </li>

			    	<li> <span class="smalldot"> </span> Energy, as a mother and full time student, I have a lot things to do everyday, so it is hard to keep my energy up high at all the time, I could feel tired and frustrated at times. my plan to deal with this situations are: 
			    		<ol>
			    			<li>Have a 10 mintues study break every 2 hours, to have a cup of tea and go out to have some fresh air;</li>
			    			<li>Do Yoga before and after my studying as Yoga can relax my body phisically and emotionally;</li>
			    			<li>Practicing deep breath, it helps me to keep calm and get more oxygen for my body</li>
			    		</ol>
			    	</li>
			 	</ul>
			 </p>
			 <p>	
			    <h3>How am I managing my workload in this programme?</h3>
			    	<ol>
			    		<li>Plan well- set up a daily study plan before studying everyday and stick with it, finish my work in time, it includes my daily study and assignemnts</li>
			    		<li>Attend every workshop on Monday morning and weekly meeting with my facilitator Kelly;</li>
			    		<li>Work efficiently, stay focus and seek help when I can't work things out</li>
			    		<li>Practicing while I am reading; coding needs lots of practice, it makes a lot of sense to me by doing it and seeing how it works rather then just keep reading</li>
						<li>Doing exercise everyday, yoga, stretches or walking; eating healthy food and having a healthy life style</li>
					</ol>
			</p>
			<p>		
				<h3>How and where will I see help in a timely way? </h3>

					The strategies that I will use when I am stuck: 
					 <ol>
					 	<li>stay calm, have a cup of tea, get some fresh air then try to solve the problem again;</li>
					 	<li>use google search</li>
					 	<li>still can't solve it? I will seek help from the Foundation or code-hlep-desk channel on EDA Slack</li>
					 	<li>or seek help from the facilitation team</li>
					 </ol>
			</p>
			<p>	 	
				<h3>What do I expect from the facilitation team?</h3>


					<ul>
						<li><span class="smalldot"></span> Good communication, please let me know what I need to work on, what I need to impove or focus on if there is something bring your attention; and I will report to you as well if there is some concerns raised from my side;</li>
						<li><span class="smalldot"></span> Provide advices/recommendations on my study</li>
						<li><span class="smalldot"></span> Assist me when I am stuck</li>
					</ul>
			</p>
			<p>		
				I have committed to do this course and so far I am really enjoying it, I will keep it up and I am ready for the coming new challenges.
