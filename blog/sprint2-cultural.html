				<h2> My Learning Agreement </h2>
			</div>	
			<hr class="hr">
			<div class="font4Tech">
				<p>This learning agreement is about how I am managing my web development courses studying at EDA. </p>

				First of all, I have passion on coding/programming, I have a bachelor degree in computer science from Auckland University and programming is always my dreaming job, no doubt that I am motivated and have fully committed to this course.

				<h3>My strengths are </h3>
				<ul>
					<li>I have learned Java before and have basic ideas about programming;</li>
					<li>I am reponsible and well organised, once I commit to it, I will try my best to achieve it</li>
					<li>I work hard and have eyes on details, I tends to finish my tasks in time and achieve my goals;</li>

				</ul>
			    <h3>My limitations are</h3>
			    <ul>
			    	<li> I am mother of two, I have to balance my study and family life, so studying efficiently is very important to me,I need to stick with my study plan and finish it on time; </li>

			    	<li> Energy, as a mother and full time student, I have a lot to do everyday, so it is hard to keep my energy high at all the time, I could feel tired and frustrated at times. my plan to deal with this situations are:
			    		<li> have a 10 mintues study break every 2 hours, to have a cup of tea and go out to have some fresh air;</li>
			    		<li> Do Yoga before and after my studying as Yoga can relax my body phicically and emotionally;</li>
			    		<li>Practicing deep breath as it can help to keep calm and deliver more oxygen to my brain;</li>
			    		
			    	</li>
			    How am I managing my workload in this programme?
			    <ol>
			    	<li>Plan well- set up a daily study plan before studying everyday and stick with it, finish my work in time, it includes my daily study and assignemnts</li>
			    	<li>work efficiently, stay focus and seek help when I can't work things out</li>
			    	<li>Practicing while I am reading; coding needs lots of practice, it makes a lot of sense to me by doing it and seeing how it works rather then just keep reading</li>
					<li> Doing yoga and stretches everyday or other exercises everyday, eating healthy food and having healthy life style</li>

				</ol>
