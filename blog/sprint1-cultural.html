        <h2>Describe personal values and ethics</h2>
    
        <p>Responsibility, reliability, loyalty, commitment, honesty, and diligence are the characters I value myself. I grew up in China, and Chinese culture has a big influence on me, my parents raised me in a very traditional Chinese way, keep your promises, being a responsible and reliable person were taught by my parents and school teachers since I was a child, responsibility, reliability  and work hard are very important core values to me and I appreciate that I have been taught that way.

        <p></p>I am a team player, would like to contribute knowledge and share ides to my team and be responsible for what I need to do and try my best to complete it in time, I work hard and always try my best to achieve the best result I can.</p>  

        This what some of my colleagues talked about me: “You are wise and open minded, especially when you are educating your kids”
“You are a responsible person and has always been committed to work.”
“You are fully focus on helping customer out on their issues and followed them up.”

This is what my daughter Caroline said about me: “ You are a very kind and responsible person, you all ways try your best to make others happy and you have done a lot of volunteer work which comes out of your own time. You make sure that when you do a job it is done right and you are capable of doing a lot of things. You are also very organised and do everything on time. You also persevere in everything you do and give it a go! ”

Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.

Ethical decision is when we face an ethical dilemma, and difficult to make a choice, a situation in which there is no clear right or wrong answer. 
I remembered the biggest ethical dilemma I have ever met was just two days after I got my New Zealand PR permit, I also received a job offer from a company that I was dreaming to work for. For a whole week, I was asking myself shall I take adventure to go to New Zealand and risk of losing my dream job or shall I take the job offer and stay in China , keep myself in the comfort zone? Obviously I chose to come to NZ as I believed life is full of uncertain and I should take risk and move out of my comfort zone, the consequences of the action was of course I need to work even harder in a new country but I have never ever regret of my decision.

Describe your strengths

Knowing my strengths and my talent is very import to me, it helps me know the great side of myself and gives me permission living on who I am in a stronger way. I believe I have
Ability to cope with failures and learn from mistakes.
Ability to prioritise, know what I need to do and plan it well
Analytical thinking, I am good at logical thinking and like to doing things in orders.
Attention to detail
Interpersonal skills.
Organisation and planning.
Enthusiasm, love to learn new things 
Trustworthiness, always keep my promise and being responsible
Discipline
Patience
Respectfulness
Dedication
My strength helps me to study hard and work hard, try to achieve the best result I can, I gained two bachelor degrees, one from a Chinese University and one from Auckland University. 
I had a very successful job before I immigrated to New Zealand 20 years ago, Immigration is a life changing decision, I understood that myself that my life would start from 0 again,  I need to adapt to the new culture, and learn a new language and get use to a new life style (I thought my English was good but I hardly understood anybody when I just arrived), those days were hard and challenging, I managed finishing my study in Auckland University with most of my papers achieved A+ results, and I was one of the student tutors in computer lab; and the most important thing is my English has been dramatically improved, I am really happy with that.
Living in New Zealand gives me the chance to experience the multi-cultures and  celebrate the differences, it really opens up my mind and I enjoy the differences of different cultures.
All those life experiences shaped me and helped to strengthen my ability of handling difficulties and being patient and never giving up.

Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.

I worked in a call centre for a big telecommunication company, quite often I needed to deal with frustrated  or angry customers, when they had products/service issues, or billing issues, customers were frustrated and didn’t want to listen  or accept what I explained to them even though I was trying my best to sort their issues out, that wasn’t something pleasant and situation like that can be really frustrating, the strategies I normally tried include:
Listening - listen to customer’s full story first, no matter how long it is
Show my empathy and my understanding of his or her issues
Stay calm and talk to customer slowly and in a calm and lower voice
Be patient, as customer wouldn’t know the products or services as much as we do, patience is very important
Take ownership, let customers to know or feel that I am trying my best to them, their issues can be sorted out, I will try my best to fix the issue, if I can’t, I will pass it onto the right person who can fix it.
My strategies worked most of the time, what other strategies I would try now? Effective communications is the key factor of sorting things out, most of customers are not technical savvy, say plain English rather than professional technical words will make more sense to them, and good humours will always help to get customers relaxed and calm down.
