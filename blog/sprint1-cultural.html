                <strong>Responsibility, reliability, loyalty, commitment, honesty, and diligence</strong> are the important values I believe in. 
                I grew up in China, and Chinese culture has a big influence on me, my parents raised me up in a very traditional Chinese way, 
                keeping your promises, being a responsible and reliable person had been taught by my parents and school teachers since I was a child, 
                responsibility, reliability  and work hard are very important core values to me and I appreciate that I have been taught that way.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am a team player, I love to contribute my knowledges and share my ideas with others, as I team member I am always being responsible for what I need to do and try my best to complete it in time, I work hard and always to achieve the best results I can.
            </p>  

            <p>
                Below are some comments on me from some of my colleagues:<br> 

                “You are wise and open minded, especially when you are educating your kids”
            </p>
            <p>
                “You are a responsible person and has always been committed to work.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “You are fully focus on helping customer out on their issues and followed them up.”
            </p>

            <p>
                This is what my daughter Caroline said about me: “ You are a very kind and responsible person, you all ways try your best to make others happy and you have done a lot of volunteer work which comes out of your own time. You make sure that when you do a job it is done right and you are capable of doing a lot of things. You are also very organised and do everything on time. You also persevere in everything you do and give it a go!”

            <strong>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, 
            the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</strong>
           

            <p>
                Ethical decision is when we face an ethical dilemma, and difficult to make a choice, a situation in which there is no clear right or wrong answers. 
                One of the biggest ethical dilemma I could remember was I needed to make a decision on "shall I emigrate to New Zealand or take an offer from my dreaming company?" as I received both notifications almost at the same time, two days after I received my New Zealand Pemernant Resident Visa, I also received a job offer 
                from a company that I was dreaming to work for. For a whole week, I was asking myself shall I take adventure to go to New Zealand and risk of losing my dream job or shall I take the job offer and stay in China, keep myself in the comfort zone? I finally chose to come to NZ as 
                I believed life is full of uncertaincy and I should take risk and move out of my comfort zone, the consequences of this action was that I might need to work even harder in a new country but now I am living one of the most beautiful countries in the world, a country that people celebrate diversity and respect difference, a country that people are nice and friendly, a country that is full of chanllenges and opportunities, I have never ever regret of my decision.

                My strength helps me to study hard and work hard, try to achieve the best result I can, I gained two bachelor degrees, one from a Chinese University and one from Auckland University. 
                I had a very successful job before I immigrated to New Zealand 20 years ago, Immigration is a life changing decision, I understood that my life would restart from 0 again,  I need to adapt to a new culture, and learn a new language and get use to a new life style (I thought my English was good but I hardly understood anybody when I just arrived), those days were hard and challenging, I managed finishing my study in Auckland University with most of my papers achieved A+ results, now I am working for Spark, one of the biggest telecommunication companies in New Zealand. 

                Living in New Zealand gives me the chance to experience the multi-cultures and celebrate the differences, it really opens up my mind and I have been enjoying the diversity of different cultures.
                All those life experiences shaped me and helped to strengthen my ability of handling difficulties and being patient and never giving up.

            <strong>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</strong>
    
            <p>
                I worked in a call centre, quite often I needed to deal with frustrated  or angry customers, when they had products/service issues, or billing issues, customers were frustrated and didn’t want to listen  or accept what I explained to them even though I was trying my best to help them, that wasn’t something pleasant and a situation like that can be really frustrating, the strategies I normally tried include:
                    
                    <li>Listening - listen to customer’s full story first, no matter how long it is</li>
                    <li>show my empathy and my understanding to their issues</li>
                    <li>Stay calm and talk to customer slowly and in a calm and lower voice</li>
                    <li>Be patient, as customer wouldn’t know the products or services as much as we do, patience is very important</li>
                    <li>Take ownership, ensure customers that I understand their issue and I am trying my best to help them, their issues can be solved, it just takes a little time, if I can’t fix it, I will pass it onto the right person who can fix it.</li> <br>
                        
                    My strategies worked most of the time, what other strategies I would try now? Using different stragies to deal with diffent cusotmer, as everyone is different, there is no way works for everyone, understanding people's needs and effective communications are the key factors of solving problems.
