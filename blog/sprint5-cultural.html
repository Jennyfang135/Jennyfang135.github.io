				<h3>1. Describe the impact the core learning has had on your Foundations learning journey.</h3>
				<p>
					Three mains things I have learned and understood more about them, and I believe they will affect my life in different ways.
					<ol>
   						<li>EQ - high emotion intellegence is the core part of personal success</li>
						<li>Growth mindset - understanding how brain works and believe in perseverance makes difference</li>

						<li>Headspace - the power of meditation, learn to balance my body and my emotion, a relaxed body and calmed emotion are the most I want, they not only help us to be successful in our career, also help us achieve a happy personal life.</li>
					</ol>

				</p>
				
				<h3>2.What are 1 - 3 new things you have learned about yourself as a result of the core learning?</h3>
				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>A lot of my mindesets are fixed mindsets and I need to keep practicing on building my growth mindsets</li>
	
						<li>My EQ needs improving, as I can be quite emotional in some situations.</li>
					</ol>
				</P>
					
				<h3>3.What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
				<p>	
					Growth mindset - learning the concept of growth mindset and reading the relative articles online has opened up my mind on how to see difficulties or failure, it fundamentally changed some of my thoughts like "you wouldn't learn much when you are older and different people good at different things, it is hard to learn things that you are not good at them", now I understand that our brain is growable, the pathway in our brain that connected our brain cells will be thicker and strengthen if we keep practicing on it, so we can be better and learn new knowledges now matter how old we are; we can be better as long as we never give up. All of these thoughts will definitely help me to learn the skills of dealing with frustration and disappointments in the future.						
				</p>
									
				<h3>4.What was the most challenge aspects of the core learning?</h3>
				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>Growth mindset, I understand the concept and fully agree with it, practicing it everyday is a challenge</li>

						<li>Headspace meditation needs to be my daily routine.</li>
					</ol>	
				</p>	
				
				<h3>5.Any thoughts you want to share about your core learning journey in Foundations?</h3>
				<p>
					Core learing journey in Foundations has been awesome experience to me, it not only taught me how to train myself on self-manangment including time management, plan well before I start, it also taught me to understand my strengthes and limitations, to understand my emotions, the way to improve my EQ, how to balance my body and my emotion, to practice my brain to be growth mindset, to believe in myself that I can be better.
