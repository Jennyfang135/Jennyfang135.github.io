				<strong>Emotional Intelligence, or emotional quotient (EQ),</strong> is defined as an individual's ability to identify, evaluate, control, and express emotions. People with high EQ usually make great leaders and team players because of their ability to understand, empathize, and connect with the people around them. IQ, or intelligence quotient, is score derived from one of several standardized tests designed to assess an individual's intelligence.

				IQ is used to determine academic abilities and identify individuals with off-the-chart intelligence or mental challenges. EQ is a better indicator of success in the workplace and is used to identify leaders, good team players, and people who best work by themselves.

				<h4>What is EQ?</h4>
				<p>
				EQ, is a measure of a person's level of emotional intelligence. This refers to a person's ability to perceive, control, evaluate, and express emotions. Researchers such as John Mayer and Peter Salovey as well as writers like Daniel Goleman have helped shine a light on emotional intelligence, making it a hot topic in areas ranging from business management to education.</p>
			</p>
			<p>

				<h4>EQ is centered on abilities such as:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="smalldot"></span> Identifying emotions</li>
					<li><span class="smalldot"></span> Evaluating how others feel</li>
					<li><span class="smalldot"></span> Controlling one's own emotions</li>
					<li><span class="smalldot"></span> Perceiving how others feel</li>
					<li><span class="smalldot"></span> Using emotions to facilitate social communication relating to others</li>
				</ul>	

			</p>
			<p>	
				<h4>What is IQ?</h4>
				
					<p>Intelligence quotient or IQ is a score received from standardized assessments designed to test intelligence. 
						IQ relates directly to intellectual pursuits such as the ability to learn as well as understand and apply 
						information to skill sets. IQ covers logical reasoning, word comprehension and math skills. People with higher 
						IQ can think in abstracts and make connections by making generalizations easier.
					</p>
				<h4>IQ represents abilities such as:</h4>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="smalldot"></span> Visual and spatial processing</li>
							<li><span class="smalldot"></span> Knowledge of the world</li>
							<li><span class="smalldot"></span> Fluid reasoning</li>
							<li><span class="smalldot"></span> Working memory and short-term memory</li>

				<h4>Characteristics of Emotional Intelligence</h4>
					<p>
			    		<ul>

							<li><strong>Self-Awareness</strong> – People with high emotional intelligence are usually very self-aware  . They understand their emotions, and because of this, they don't let their feelings rule them. They're confident – because they trust</li>

							<li>They're also willing to take an honest look at themselves. They know their strengths and weaknesses, and they work on these areas so they can perform better. Many people believe that this self-awareness is the most important part of emotional intelligence.</li>

							<li><strong>Self-Regulation</strong> – This is the ability to control emotions   and impulses. People who self-regulate typically don't allow themselves to become too angry or jealous, and they don't make impulsive, careless decisions. They think before they act. Characteristics of self-regulation are thoughtfulness, comfort with change, integrity  , and the ability to say no.</li>
				
							<li><strong>Motivation</strong>. – People with a high degree of emotional intelligence are usually motivated  . They're willing to defer immediate results for long-term success. They're highly productive, love a challenge, and are very effective in whatever they do.</li>
				
							<li><strong>Empathy</strong> – This is perhaps the second-most important element of emotional intelligence. Empathy   is the ability to identify with and understand the wants, needs, and viewpoints of those around you. People with empathy are good at recognizing the feelings of others, even when those feelings may not be obvious. As a result, empathetic people are usually excellent at managing relationships  , listening  , and relating to others. They avoid stereotyping and judging too quickly, and they live their lives in a very open, honest way.</li>
				
							<li><strong>Social Skills</strong> – It's usually easy to talk to and like people with good social skills, another sign of high emotional intelligence. Those with strong social skills are typically team players. Rather than focus on their own success first, they help others develop and shine. They can manage disputes, are excellent communicators, and are masters at building and maintaining relationships.</li>
						</ul>	
					</p>	
			
				
				<h4>Can you really improve your EQ? </h4>
				<p>
					Who wouldn’t want a higher level of emotional intelligence? Studies have shown that a high emotional quotient (or EQ) boosts career success, entrepreneurial potential, leadership talent, health, relationship satisfaction, humor, and happiness. It is also the best antidote to work stress and it matters in every job — because all jobs involve dealing with people, and people with higher EQ are more rewarding to deal with.
				</p>	
				<p>	
					The good news is that emotional intelligence can be learned and developed. As well as working on your skills in the five areas above, use these strategies:
				</p>
				<p>
					<ol>
						
						<li><strong>Observe how you react to people.</strong> Do you rush to judgment before you know all of the facts? Do you stereotype? Look honestly at how you think and interact with other people. <strong>Try to put yourself in their place</strong> , and be more open and accepting of their perspectives and needs.</li>
				
						<li><strong>Look at your work environment.</strong> Do you seek attention for your accomplishments? Humility can be a wonderful quality, and it doesn't mean that you're shy or lack self-confidence. When you practice humility, you say that you know what you did, and you can be quietly confident about it. Give others a chance to shine – put the focus on them, and don't worry too much about getting praise for yourself.</li>

						<li><strong>Do a self-evaluation. </strong>Try out our emotional intelligence quiz  . What are your weaknesses? Are you willing to accept that you're not perfect and that you could work on some areas to make yourself a better person? Have the courage to look at yourself honestly – it can change your life.</li>
				
						<li><strong>Examine how you react to stressful situations.</strong> Do you become upset every time there's a delay or something doesn't happen the way you want? Do you blame others or become angry at them, even when it's not their fault? The ability to stay calm and in control in difficult situations is highly valued – in the business world and outside it. Keep your emotions under control when things go wrong.</li>
				
						<li><strong>Take responsibility </strong> for your actions. If you hurt someone's feelings, apologize  directly – don't ignore what you did or avoid the person. People are usually more willing to forgive and forget if you make an honest attempt to make things right.</li>
				
						<li><strong>Examine how your actions will affect others – before you take those actions.</strong> If your decision will impact others, put yourself in their place. How will they feel if you do this? Would you want that experience? If you must take the action, how can you help others deal </li>
					</ol>
				</p>	
			

			
				<h4>Summary</h4>
			<p>
					Life success is a result of many factors, although "regular" intelligence is important to success in life, emotional intelligence is key to relating well to others and achieving your goals. Many people believe both IQ and EQ undoubtedly play roles in influencing your overall success, as well as things such as health, wellness, and happiness. 

					Emotional intelligence is an awareness of your actions and feelings – and how they affect those around you. It also means that you value others, listen to their wants and needs, and are able to empathize or identify with them on many different levels.
